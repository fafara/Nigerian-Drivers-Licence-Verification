## Android Version
An Android version for single licence verification can be downloaded here: https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.edgewalk.licencevalidator

## Issues
Please create an issue if there's a problem. The application was built with Java and requires Java JRE to run. I think most Windows machines will have that. If not download here: https://www.oracle.com/technetwork/java/javase/downloads/jre8-downloads-2133155.html

This is a rough work in just a day and its not perfect or intended to solve all your problems. It just helps the process of verification easier for companies or people who need to verify the identity of their clients.
